# SHINY DASHBOARD APP 
#
# ERROR IDENTIFICATION MODULE FOR HEALTH FACITLITY SURVEY APP V1.0
#
# THE OUTPUTS IS IN TABLE FORMAT AND THE FILTERS AS FOLLOWING 
#
# Identify discrepancies between the reported age and the calculated age based on the date of birth
# Identify number of pregnancies carried to term is greater than the number of pregnancies
# Identify records where the number of pregnancies reported exceeds five
# Highlight records where the date of data collection is missing
# Identify records where consent was not reported for RDT(Rapid Diagnostic Test) or DBS (Dried Blood Spot) samples
# Identifying incomplete records
# 
# This module reads data from a static CSV file and visualize it in a table considering the filter selected
#
#
# THIS MODULE CAN BE USE TO VIEW ERROR IS HOUSEHOLD SURVEY AND LONGITUDINAL SURVEYS
